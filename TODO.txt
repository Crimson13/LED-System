To Do:

*Possibly begin work on being able to mix zones and modes.  
	Need to discuss menu layout for this.

*Change how we talk to the LCD to "i2C" format.
	Both the LCD and nunchuck will use same pins, this opens up more pins for other use. (http://www.ladyada.net/products/i2cspilcdbackpack)

*After LCD is changed to i2C, add RGB led pods.
	New pseudo "zones" will be made for this.  (http://www.ladyada.net/products/pixel20mm/)

Bugs/Fixes:

*Fix/Redo "FORD" logo.  (Crim will work on this)
