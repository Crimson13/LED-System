To Do:

*Add Zone #2. (pins 4, 5)

*Add new flash patterns. (Crim will add txt files for them like mode1.txt)
	Patterns will include 1v1 or "wigwag" and a both on/off (like car hazards)


Bugs/Fixes:
 
*Make all Zones and Modes defualt to "OFF"

*When Mode is on, and a zone is turned off you can catch a light on.  
	Make all pins in zone go low when zone turned to off.

*Fix/Redo "FORD" logo.  (Crim will work on this)
